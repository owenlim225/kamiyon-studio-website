# Kamiyon Studio Official Website

The official marketing site for Kamiyon Studio — a Filipino creative technology studio building games and interactive experiences that educate, inspire, and make a lasting impact.

**Motto (site):** Create. Play. Inspire.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + React 19 |
| UI | Tailwind CSS 4 + design tokens |
| Content (current) | Typed fallbacks in `lib/cms/fallbacks/` |
| Content (target) | Sanity + GROQ; Studio at `/studio` |
