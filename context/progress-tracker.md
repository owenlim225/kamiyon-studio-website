# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.

## Archival process

When a task/phase is marked complete:

1. Create `context/completed/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with the finished context.
2. Add a row/link in [`completed/README.md`](./completed/README.md).
3. Remove bulky finished blocks from this file; leave at most a one-line pointer.
4. Do not delete historical detail — relocate it.

**Historical completed work:** [`completed/README.md`](./completed/README.md)

## Current Phase

**Phase E — Wave 3 verified (2026-07-24):** Staging Worker + hosted Studio confirmed working. **Wave 4 (apex DNS cutover) is next**, run **in parallel** with QA polish streams (see below).

| Surface | URL | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staging site | https://kamiyon-studio-website-staging.limosnerosherwin.workers.dev | Live (Workers Free ~2.2 MiB gzip) |
| Hosted Studio | https://kamiyon.sanity.studio/ | Live (login + desk OK) |
| Staging `/studio` | same Worker → redirect | → hosted Studio |
| Media CDN (staging) | https://media-staging.kamiyonstudio.com | Active |
| Media CDN (prod) | https://media.kamiyonstudio.com | Active |
| Production site | https://kamiyonstudio.com | Still on prior host until Wave 4 |

## Locked product answers (2026-07-24)

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Interim contact CTA | External [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIefAWJu5FP9pwljLFz1wSUxU2ybR3--GdylUYUBsGHH0yaw/viewform) (linked button) |
| QA-001 | Out of app scope — Google Forms confirmation settings |
| Same-route nav | Smooth-scroll to top / target section |
| Scroll tip | Keep bounce UX; first scroll must count |
| QA-008 hamburger | Superseded by kinetic nav (ADR-008) |
| QA vs Wave 4 | Parallel |
| T8 (later) | Resend → studio inbox + visitor confirmation; confirm `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` |

## Parallel workstreams (multitask fan-out)

```text
Batch 1 (now, no shared files):
  WS0 Context hygiene     ── done 2026-07-24
  WS1 Hero scroll/hint    ── done 2026-07-24 (QA-002, 009, 010)
  WS2 Kinetic chrome QA   ── done 2026-07-24 (QA-003 fixed; QA-004 N/R)
  WS4a Staging ops        ── done 2026-07-24
  WS6 Blog/Analytics      ── T9 / T14 (optional)

Batch 2 (after Batch 1 + policy locked):
  WS3 Same-route scroll   ── done 2026-07-24 (QA-005, 006, 007 + Google Form CTA)

Batch 3 (serial ops):
  WS4b Wave 4 DNS cutover

Batch 4:
  WS5 T8 Resend form (after inbox confirmed; prod secrets after WS4b)
  WS7 E2E T15 (after WS3 + WS5)

Batch S (CMS seed — done 2026-07-24):
  WS8a–f Sanity content seed ── partner schema + builders + CLI + live upsert (ADR-011)
```

| Stream | Scope | Owns (avoid cross-edits) | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **WS0** | Context triage | `context/*` | — | **Done** |
| **WS1** | First scroll counts; × dismiss | `useHeroScrollBounce*`, `HeroScrollHelper*` | — | **Done** — tip dismisses on first intent (no return-to-top); × + pointer-events isolation |
| **WS2** | Re-QA logo on kinetic; fix if repro | `sterling-gate-kinetic-navigation*`, `SiteHeader*` | Soft: WS1 if tip steals clicks | **Done** — QA-003 fixed (frosted logo chrome on dark hero); QA-004 cannot repro (hits OK; tip stacking owned by WS1) |
| **WS3** | Same-route → scroll; wire Google Form CTA | nav helpers, footer, contact CTAs, `lib/config/navigation`, channels/fallbacks | WS1/WS2 soft; answers locked | **Done** — same-route `SameRouteLink` + helpers; interim Google Form as primary CTA |
| **WS4a** | Staging webhook + Studio API origin / R2 smoke | CF/Sanity ops, `deploy-runbook` | — | **Done** |
| **WS4b** | Apex/www → prod Worker; pause Vercel | DNS + prod env | WS4a green | Ready (after Batch 1 polish) |
| **WS5** | T8 Resend native form | contact API + UI | Inbox decision; prod after WS4b | Later |
| **WS6** | T9 blog UI / T14 CF Analytics | blog routes, analytics snippet | — | Optional parallel |
| **WS7** | T15 E2E expansion | `e2e/*` | WS3 + WS5 | Later |
| **WS8** | Sanity seed (fallbacks → dataset) | `scripts/sanity/seed/*`, `partner` schema, `lib/cms` partner plumbing | — | **Done** — 42 docs on `kamiyon` (ADR-011) |

**Conflict edge:** Hero tip `z-20` vs header logo clicks — WS1 owns tip stacking; WS2 re-tests logo after.

---

## Current Goal

1. Batch 1 polish streams done (WS0/WS1/WS2/WS4a). Batch 2 WS3 done.  
2. Optional: WS6 (blog UI / CF Analytics) in parallel.  
3. Next serial: **WS4b** apex DNS cutover → then WS5/WS7.

## Recently completed (2026-07-24)

- **WS8 Sanity content seed** — Partner schema + `pnpm sanity:seed` (42 docs); fallbacks kept; `getCmsImageUrl` allowlists media CDN. Archive: [`completed/2026-07-24-sanity-content-seed.md`](./completed/2026-07-24-sanity-content-seed.md) (ADR-011).
- **WS3 same-route scroll + Google Form CTA** — Shared `lib/navigation/same-route-scroll` + `SameRouteLink` (header/footer/CTAs); interim primary CTA → Google Form (`INTERIM_CONTACT_FORM_URL` / `CONTACT_CTA`); `/contact` nav page kept for channels. Resolves QA-005/006/007 (external Form skips same-route scroll).
- **WS2 kinetic chrome QA** — QA-003: frosted logo chrome so ink wordmark readable on dark hero; QA-004: cannot repro as hit-target (logo hits OK; tip stacking = WS1). No new menu freezes under toggle stress.
- **WS4a staging ops** — Sanity webhook → staging `/api/revalidate` (Bearer); Studio redeploy with `SANITY_STUDIO_API_ORIGIN` + upload secret; R2 API smoke OK. Details: [`deploy-runbook.md`](./deploy-runbook.md).
- **WS0 context hygiene** — QA triage, workstreams, contact/Studio doc alignment (ADR-010).
- **Hosted Studio live** — `pnpm sanity:deploy` → https://kamiyon.sanity.studio/ (app id in `sanity.cli.ts`).
- **Studio env bake-in (ADR-009)** — static `SANITY_STUDIO_*` reads + defaults.
- **Sanity CORS** — credentials for Studio + staging Worker.
- **Kinetic nav (Track G / ADR-008)** — `SterlingGateKineticNavigation` in `SiteHeader`.
- **OpenNext staging** — R2 bindings, staging vars, secrets set.
- **Build fixes** — `next build --webpack` + `*.ttf.bin` loader; OG routes on node runtime.

## Recent polish (2026-07-24)

- **Display headings:** CinematicFooter glow/size treatment (`footer-text-glow` + `text-5xl`/`md:text-8xl`/`font-black`) is now the default for `WordPullUp` section titles (home: Projects, Services, Contact).
- **Site cross-hatch:** Subtle fixed `.site-bg-grid` overlay (1% lines; footer keeps its own 3% masked grid).

## Architecture Decisions (active)
