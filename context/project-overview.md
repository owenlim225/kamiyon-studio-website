# Kamiyon Studio Official Website

## Overview

This repository builds the **official Kamiyon Studio marketing website** — the studio's digital headquarters. The site introduces Kamiyon to prospective clients, partners, players, media, and future team members; showcases original IP and services; and builds trust through brand-compliant design and evidence-based storytelling.

**Source of truth for company facts:** [`docs/`](../docs/) (Kamiyon canon).  
**Build instructions for agents:** `context/` files (this folder).  
**Runtime content:** Typed fallbacks until Sanity is wired; target CMS is Sanity (see [`WEBSITE-ESSENTIAL-CONTEXT.md`](./WEBSITE-ESSENTIAL-CONTEXT.md)).

Kamiyon Studio is a Filipino creative technology studio founded in **2024** in **Biñan City, Laguna, Philippines**. It operates as both a client-services agency and an original IP studio, creating games and interactive experiences that educate, inspire, and make a lasting impact.

## Goals

1. **Communicate identity** — Visitors understand who Kamiyon is, what we do, and why it matters within seconds of landing.
2. **Showcase capability** — All seven site sections render from CMS with brand-compliant placeholder content until real entries exist.
3. **Build trust** — Professional, creative, approachable presentation backed by canon facts (team, values, products) — never fabricated clients or achievements.
4. **Drive meaningful action** — Clear CTAs that route to Services, Products, Portfolio, Community, or Contact.
5. **Support discoverability** — Semantic structure, meaningful headings, and performance standards per website guidelines.

## Success Criteria

1. All seven sections render with brand-compliant layout and CMS-driven (or fallback) content.
2. Every factual claim on the site traces to `docs/` canon or published CMS entries — no invented history, clients, or achievements.
3. Canon vs Vision clearly distinguished where long-term aspirations appear (e.g., global multimedia company, future site sections).
4. Contact page works via external links; no forms or auth.
5. Design uses locked brand hex tokens, Geologica/Montserrat typography, and logo/mascot usage rules.
6. `npm run build` passes after implementation phases.
7. Placeholder content is generic and brand-appropriate — never fake case studies or awards.
